# Siglent Oscilloscopes

Currently there are two drivers available for Siglent Scopes. The legacy driver is for scopes before the SDS5000X series release, it uses SCPI like commands but doesn't follow the standard other than the few mandatory system commands. The newer E11A driver is more inline with the SCPI standard and instruments from other vendors.
